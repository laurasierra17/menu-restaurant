# menu-restaurant

For this project, which took a whole weekend (plus a few hours) to complete, I reinvented the first development project from my Mobile Development class.

Here, I've implemented a Shopping Cart and the user is able to add ONE instance of each item in the Menu into their cart. They can also remove items for the cart and view their bill total.
